# Requirements

## Software

You will need to install Chrome and Firefox for testing. Further, this plugin is written in Javascript, JQuery, CSS, and HTML; therefore there are no specific software requirements or dependencies for development.

## Google and Firefox Developer Account

To allow users to install this plugin via the Chrome Web Store and the Firefox Add-Ons pages you will need a [Google Developer account](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/register/) and a [Mozilla Developer account](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/). These accounts are not necessary if you are locally editing the plugin.
